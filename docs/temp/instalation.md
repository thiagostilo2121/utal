# Instalation

To install PyUTAL, it is recommended to first create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Install `virtualenv` if you don’t have it yet:
   ```sh
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows:**
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install `utal` inside the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   pip install utal
   ```

5. To import `utal` you may use only:
    ```python
    import utal
    ```
