# Class Types

In `utal`, there are different types of classes (`class` in Python) that divide the library.

## For Server

The `for server` classes in `utal` are the types of classes used with, for example, the bot or app. These are not linked to the HTML structure of the TikTok web app. An example is the [Client](client-class.md) class, which includes functions like `listen`.

## By Structure

The `by structure` classes in `utal` are the types of classes that *are* linked to the HTML structure of the TikTok web app, such as the [Conversation](conversation-class.md) class, which provides functions to interact with the current conversation.
