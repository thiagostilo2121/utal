PyUTAL (*Unofficial TikTok Automation Library*) is a Python library designed to develop chatbots or automate TikTok's direct messages (not TikTok Live) using Selenium.

## Installation

To install PyUTAL, it is recommended to first create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Install `virtualenv` if you donâ€™t have it yet:
   ```sh
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows:**
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install `utal` inside the virtual environment:
   ```sh
   pip install utal
   ```

## Quick Start

Here is a guide to setting up a simple project using `utal`.

1. Initialize the `webdriver` with Selenium **without** headless mode the first time to log in manually.
2. Then, use the following code:

```python
import os
import utal as ut
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

def startup_selenium():
    USERDATADIR = os.path.abspath("path/to/user/data/directory")
    DRIVERPATH = "path/to/webdriver"

    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)
    options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run without headless mode the first time
    options.add_argument(rf"user-data-dir={USERDATADIR}")
    
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(DRIVERPATH), options=options)
    return driver  # Important to return the driver

def main(driver):
    driver.get("https://tiktok.com/messages")
    
    while True:  # Important to use loops
        message = ut.Client.listen(driver=driver)  # Retrieves all messages
        print(message)

        if message and message == "hello":  
            user_nickname = ut.Conversation.get_user_nickname(driver)
            ut.Conversation.send(driver, f"Hi, {user_nickname} ðŸŒŸ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    driver = startup_selenium()
    main(driver)
```

- Console output (if the user sends "hello")

```sh
hello
```

- Bot response (if the nickname is "thiago")
```sh
Hi, thiago ðŸŒŸ
```

## Important Notes
- **Headless mode must be disabled the first time** to allow manual login and save session data.
- **A loop is required** for the bot to continuously listen for incoming messages.
- **The bot does NOT have a prefix configured and does not filter its own messages** in this example. See the [documentation]() to learn how to implement that.

## Next Steps
These are just recommendations.

- Implement a system of custom prefixes for each user.
- Develop a `command handler` to structure the botâ€™s commands better.
- Use a database to store bot or user information.
- Take inspiration from Discord bot development structures.
- Experiment and test the different functions of the library.
- See the [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) to scale the project.

## Disclaimers
